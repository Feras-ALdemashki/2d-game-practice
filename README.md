# 2D Game Practice

This project is a simple 2D platformer prototype created to practice fundamental game development concepts, including:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for structuring game entities such as players and platforms
- Implementing a game loop for continuous updating and rendering
- Basic collision detection between player and platforms
- Drawing shapes and images using the HTML5 Canvas API

The project serves as a hands-on introduction to building games with JavaScript and the Canvas, focusing on understanding game logic, player movement, and interaction within a 2D environment.

## Features

- Player movement with left, right, and jump controls
- Platforms to stand and jump on
- Gravity simulation and collision handling
- Background image rendering
